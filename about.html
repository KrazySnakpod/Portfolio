            <p>
              I am a Game Developer from Bridgend, Wales. I've always had a strong passion for video games and understanding how they work, which evolved into a desire to work on them as I got older. I first started developing games at 11 years old, where I worked with programs such as <i>GameMaker</i> to create simple games, and over the years I've moved further into more advanced languages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wanting to learn more about game development, I decided to enrol in the Games Design and Development course at Cardiff Metropolitan University, where I furthered my skills in languages such as C++ and C#, and developed games using Unity and Unreal Engine. During my time at University, I also learned about the backend side of game development, using multiple custom engines utilizing pieces of middleware such as Ogre3D, Bullet and OpenGL to further my understanding on rendering and physics engines.

        </div>
        <div class="work__text">
          <p>
            Outside of University, I've made a few games as personal projects or as Game Jam submissions. My favourite of these was <i>Clownery</i>, a game created during the Global Game Jam 2024 in which the players play as clowns who must make money during the daytime to buy tools to help them more efficiently steal from houses during the nighttime. Working as part of a team was a great experience and gave me a greater understanding of how to develop games as a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favourite games to play are primarily turn-based RPGs and games that could be described as "Roguelikes", however I'm also fond of action RPGs. As a game developer, I'd love to create a game in this genre, something that I've toyed with in the past with my untitled turn-based RPG and untitled action RPG projects. I'd love the opportunity to expand these into full games as opposed to the simple demonstrations they are currently.
