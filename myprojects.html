                <p>
                  Drawing inspiration from games from the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> franchise, I wanted to try to implement an ARPG combat system using Unreal Engine. This project was started in June 2024, and as such is very early in development, with the player only able to navigate the menu and target enemies.

              <p>
                Inspired by numerous turn-based RPG games, I wanted to find out how the combat system in these games could be implemented. The player is able to use a basic attack, use skills costing HP or MP, and inflict status ailments that deal damage over time. Each entity has their own stat table, determining stats such as health, physical attack and speed dependent on their current level. This project started in Summer 2023 as my first Unreal Engine project.

With enough intel, Rob can complete the level, where his grade is determined by how long the level took and whether he used any items or a disguise.

As a group, we decided that visualizing the data set using a series of roads in the style of the game <i>Crossy Road</i> would be effective for this task, with the number of cars on the roads representing the data. In this project, I was responsible for the items system, the VR setup and much of the main backend systems, such as the ability to dynamically change the world by changing just the data set.

The final game is a near identical copy of <i>Asteroids</i>, with network functionality added enabling multiplayer, however the score is not currently tracked.

I decided on a more aquatic theme for my assets, creating a cuttlefish which I would use as my player character, a crab to act as an enemy, and a ruined pirate ship for the stage.
